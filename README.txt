File Splitter

This program does what it says on the can: it splits files into smaller pieces, thus making it possible to do things like email large files to yourself or others incrementally. (This is handy when, for instance, you are forced to deal with the draconian limitations some companies put on Internet access, making better-suited solutions like FTP or Dropbox impossible.)

File Splitter allows you to define the size of chunks you want and also featuers the ability to Base64-encode each chunk (making them appear more friendly to some zealous email filtering systems).

File Splitter is released under the MIT license.
